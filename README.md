<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project is currently a Work In Progress and is being worked on towards completion. An owner and chef of a local restaurant asked me to build a custom website for his restaurant.

The client gave me a complete directive over the design and technical build of the website.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started Disclaimer

Unfortunately this project is not set up to be downloaded and run on a local machine. This is because API calls are made to the Contentful CMS where the data and assets are stored. A Contentful space is to be kept secure by keeping the Space ID and Delivery Access Token private at all times

However the code can be reviewed on a local machine by cloning the repo:

```js
git clone https://github.com/usamalodhi/4Thurlestone-Restaurant-Contentful-CMS
```

<!-- Learnings -->

## Challenges and Learnings

<hr/>

There are several challenges that I have dealt with with learning outcomes towards making me a better developer

The biggest challenge was not having any direction over the design or technical build as website design and build is not an area of the clients expertise. Prior to starting the project I researched on current UI/UX design practices in modern web design which I have attempted to include in my design. I also researched on modern website build practices. I decided that a Gatsby production website known for fast, responsive static builds and the Contentful CMS which allows for easy modification of data, is the the way to go
